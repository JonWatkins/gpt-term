## Adding your openai apiKey

The first time you run the `chat` function it will prompt you for your apiKey if you have not allready provided one.
If you want to add your key first you may call the `addkey` function.

```bash
gpt-term addkey --key YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE
```

Please not that if you run the `addkey` function again it will overwrite your apiKey.

## Removing your openai apiKey

To remove your apiKey you can call the `removekey` function. This will delete the encrypted key file from your machine.

```bash
gpt-term removekey
```

After doing this the next time you run the `chat` function it will prompt you again for your apiKey.
