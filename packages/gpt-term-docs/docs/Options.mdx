## How to use command line options

Most command line options are simple strings, such as the engine name `gpt-3.5-turbo` in the following example:

```bash
gpt-term chat --engine gpt-3.5-turbo
```

## Supported commandline options

### -v, --verbose

This option enables verbose logging, providing more detailed information during the execution of the CLI application.

### -e, --engine *&lt;string&gt;*

Use this option to specify the ChatGpt model to use for the conversation. You can choose from different models available.

### -m, --max-tokens *&lt;number&gt;*

With this option, you can set the maximum number of tokens to generate in the chat completion. Tokens are units of text used by the model for processing.

### -t, --temperature *&lt;number&gt;*

The sampling temperature determines the randomness of the output. You can set a value between 0 and 2, where higher values make the output more random.

### -p, --presence-penalty *&lt;number&gt;*

This option allows you to influence the model's likelihood of talking about new topics. You can set a number between -2.0 and 2.0, where positive values increase the likelihood.

### -f, --frequency-penalty *&lt;number&gt;* 

Use this option to control the model's likelihood of repeating the same line verbatim. Positive values between -2.0 and 2.0 decrease the likelihood.

### -s, --system-prompt *&lt;string&gt;*

Specify your set of rules and instructions to guide the model's behavior in the conversation. This prompt helps the model understand the context and expectations.
